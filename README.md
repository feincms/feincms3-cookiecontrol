## Software design

### Mixin f√ºr feincms3 Pages

The following values may be defined on a feincms3 page and are inherited by descendants:

class CoookieControlMixin(models.Model):
    Panel heading
    Panel content
    Banner content
    legal_page = ForeignKey("self")

    class Meta:
        abstract = True

### Definition of cookie categories and scripts

Cookie categories and scripts are defined in the CMS, exactly as it is done now.
